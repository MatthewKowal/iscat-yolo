### Automated Particle Detection, Localization, and Measurement for iSCAT Microscope Video

Keywords: Intrferometric Scattering Microscopy, Mass Photometry, Ratiometric Video Processing, YOLOv8, Dynamic Nano-Microscopy, Particle Detection, Localization, Measurement

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for processing for Interferometric Scattering Microscopy Video Data. 
The general workflow is as follows:
1) Open 8-bit binary video file
2) Convert raw video to ratiometric video and locate particles on each frame
3) Perform data quality assurance (remove false positives)
4) Generate plots, spreadsheets and output statistics


## Example Output
Example output video showing initiation and cessation of 50 nm Polystyrene Nanoplastics deposition onto a coverslip during an EPD-iSCAT experiment.
